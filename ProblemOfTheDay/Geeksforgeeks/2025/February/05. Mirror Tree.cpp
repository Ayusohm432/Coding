/*Mirror Tree

Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.

Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]
Output: [1, 3, 2, N, 4]
Explanation: 

In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 3, 2, N, N, 5, 4]
Explanation:

In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 105

/* A binary tree node has data, pointer to left child
   and a pointer to right child /
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
}; */

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        // code here
        if(!node){
            return;
        }
        mirror(node->left);
        mirror(node->right);
        swap(node->left , node->right);
    }
